# EAN-NevLag24

###

## About
This project is my ticket to the next semester. *I hope.* <br>
It is a simple GUI-based program executing Lagrange's polynomial interpolation, as well as Neville's interpolation
in order to find any value of the interpolated function. Interpolation interpolation interpolation. <br>
The application works in **three arithmetic modes**: Real numbers, Interval arithmetic and Singletons - 
Real numbers expressed as Intervals of singular value. <br>
The user may choose any arithmetic from the level of the UI, and is presented with suggestions on proper 
formatting via input field placeholders. These placeholders can be used as input values themselves, 
allowing for a run-and-go demo presentation.
